GitHub does not support all the Markdown feature that I use in the transcript, e.g. ToC and Mermaid graphs.

Therefore I have rendered the Markdown to HTML. As GitHub does not present HTML as one would expect, here are links for easy viewing:

* dark: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lending-llama/lending-llama-2021-11/blob/main/extras/transcript.dark.html
